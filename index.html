Each campsite is private, with its own stretch of lush green lawn and private ablutions. There’s trout in the river and hiking and mountain biking trails in the vicinity. For sport events that you just can’t miss, ask in advance for access to the big screen and DStv.

                                    Sunset on the Langeberg is one of the most beautiful sights in South Africa, and Oewerzicht is a wonderful place to enjoy it. Apart from the stunning scenery, there’s also fishing and canoeing in the Riviersonderend River which gurgles right past the campground, plus hiking and mountain biking through the surrounding farmland. The ablutions are modern and first class and if you need supplies, the charming town of Greyton is just down the road.

                        If you truly want to leave city life behind you for awhile, you will find it difficult to resist the call of the Cederberg. The reserve is only a couple of hours out of Cape Town, yet this ancient landscape will transport you to a time when humanity still roamed the wilderness, sheltering in caves by night and huddling around fires as darkness closed in. A number of trails wind their way throughout the reserve, with the Algeria Campsite serving as a hub from which hikers can explore the Cederberg at their own pace. Famous natural landmarks include the Wolfsberg Arch – a giant rock-formed archway; and the Stadsaal Caves, which contains San art dating back thousand of years.

                                This hike is named for the African Black Oystercatcher, a rare species of bird that dwells in the coastal regions of Southern Africa, making its nests in sandy soil, and feeding on mussels that wash up on shore. Hikers have an idea what to expect when they take part in this guided trail: long stretches of sandy coastline from which dolphins and whales can occasionally be sighted, cliffs overlooking the ocean, and a thriving biodiversity. But the journey also provides a glimpse into the region’s rich heritage, passing through villages containing classic examples of Cape Dutch architecture. In fact, the trail offers insight into the history of our entire species, as the itinerary includes a tour of the Pinnacle Point Caves, where the earliest evidence of humans crafting tools, drawing symbols and catching fish have been discovered.

                                Krakadouw is an imposing venue in the remote northern Cederberg that it is on the hit list of every hard-core trad climber. The long, somewhat intimidating routes are on impressive amphitheatres on the southern and western sides of the Groot Krakadouw peak. There are some fun single pitch routes on middle Krakadouw. There is nothing easy here and all the routes are pretty solid in their grades, so to really have fun at Krakadouw you need to be climbing consistently and well at about grade 21.

Montagu is a fantastic tourist destination. Surrounded by vineyards, orchids, and natural springs, the unique rock formations make it one of the most desirable climbing destinations in the Cape region. With over three hundred bolted routes at all grades, Montagu offers endless excitement for both trad and sport climbers. And no more than a month has passed since the 2008 Montagu Rock Rally, meaning freshly chalked routes and flattened trails.

Dive to the parking area at Tom se Klip (Silversands Beach) and walk down to the coast. Dawidskraal, Tom’s se Klip, Silwerstrand Beach and Jock se Baai. Wonder worm is the best bait in this area, and you can expect to catch geelbek, kob, steenbras, belman and galjoen. Mussel is good bait too. If you want to go for sharkies, there are plenty of spotties, smoothies and the odd cow shark around.

                                                In June anglers come from all over for the snoek which is caught at the harbour. For Palmiet beach, turn towards the parking site on the road to the Caravan Park. Here you can try for galjoen and steenbras in front of the caravan park and the river mouth, using prawn and mussel. Fly fish for small leeries on the vlei. For beach fishing, walk along the Main Beach to the High Dune; fish from the rocks along the shoreline at Sandown Bay, you may get the odd galjoen in season. You could also find sharks (vaalies) about a 1km down the Main Beach, but you will need a very good cast to get to them. The rocks in front of Main Beach are good for galjoen, further along the beach the surf yields streenbras and cob/kabeljou. In November, Cape salmon can be caught from the beach.
